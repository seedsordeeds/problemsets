# [Easy] Problem 1: Find the distance!

The challenge is to write a function that computes the distance between two points A and B with coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively.

# [Intermediate/Hard] Problem 2: 



# Solution 1: 

```
def dist(x1, x2, y1, y2):
	distance = (((x1-x2)**2)+((y1-y2)**2))**(1/2)
	return distance
```

# Solution 2:
